# FaceApp - Facial Recognition Web Application

FaceApp is a web-based application that enables face detection, facial recognition, facial expression analysis, and face similarity comparison using the face-api.js library and a Node.js + Express backend. It allows users to upload images, analyze faces, and get insights into recognized individuals and their expressionsfacial recognition and expression detection application that leverages face-api.js and Express.js to detect, recognize, and analyze facial expressions. The project includes both a React.js frontend and an Express.js backend to process and display results.


## Features
- 1️⃣ Face Detection

Detects faces in an uploaded image.

Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.

Returns the processed image with detected faces highlighted.

2️⃣ Facial Recognition

Compares an uploaded face with a set of known faces stored in the known_faces directory.

Uses deep learning models (face-api.js) to compute facial embeddings and compare them.

Identifies and returns the best match for the detected face.

3️⃣ Facial Expression Analysis

Detects common facial expressions like:

Happy

Sad

Angry

Surprised

Disgusted

Fearful

Neutral

Displays a labeled image with identified expressions.

4️⃣ Face Similarity Comparison

Accepts two images and calculates their similarity using Euclidean distance between their face embeddings.

Returns a similarity score (lower distance indicates higher similarity).


## Project Structure
The project consists of both frontend and backend components.

## 🛠 Setup Instructions
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dhanya-krishnan-4502/FaceApp---Web-Application.git
cd FaceApp
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
#### Install Backend (Express.js)
```sh
cd server
npm install
```

#### Install Frontend (React.js)
```sh
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Set Up FaceAPI Models
Ensure that the `models/` directory contains the required FaceAPI models. If not, download them from the FaceAPI repository and place them inside `server/models/`.

### 4️⃣ Fix Node.js Version Compatibility Issues
If you encounter an error related to `canvas` or module version mismatches, follow these steps:

#### Check Node.js Version
```sh
node -v
```
Compare it with the required **NODE_MODULE_VERSION** in the error message. If your version is mismatched, downgrade using `nvm`.

#### Install an Older Node.js Version with `nvm`
If `nvm` is not installed, install it first:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc if using zsh
```

Check available Node.js versions:
```sh
nvm ls
```
If the required version isn't installed, install it:
```sh
nvm install 16   # Example: install Node.js v16
nvm use 16       # Switch to Node.js v16
```

#### Rebuild Dependencies
```sh
npm rebuild
npm install
```

#### Remove & Reinstall `canvas`
If the issue persists, reinstall `canvas`:
```sh
npm uninstall canvas
npm install canvas
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Server
```sh
cd server
node server.js
```
The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:8000/`.

### 6️⃣ Start the React Frontend
```sh
cd ../client
npm start
```
The frontend should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the web application in a browser.
2. Use the **Face Detection** feature to upload an image and detect faces.
3. Use **Face Recognition** to match detected faces against stored known faces.
4. Upload two images to **Face Similarity** to compare how similar the faces are.
5. Analyze **Facial Expressions** from the uploaded image.

## ❌ Troubleshooting
- If `node_modules` was accidentally added to Git, remove it using:
  ```sh
  git rm -r --cached node_modules/
  echo 'node_modules/' >> .gitignore
  git commit -m 'Removed node_modules'
  git push origin main
  ```
- If Git LFS isn't installed, install it via:
  ```sh
  git lfs install
  ```

## 🛠 Technologies Used
